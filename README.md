## Highlights
  - 

## Major Package Functions
  - [`robot/subsystems`](src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems)

    - Contains all subsystems used in the robot, such as [`Intake.java`](src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/Intake.java) which can detect if we have a game piece, and [`Climber.java`](src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/Climber.java) which can conform to the chain to keep the robot level.
 
  - [`robot/util`](src/main/java/frc/robot/util)

    - Utility folder that manages things like [`PatriBoxController.java`](src/main/java/frc/robot/util/PatriBoxController.java)s and a special [`Neo.java`](src/main/java/frc/robot/util/Neo.java) which is capable of running in simulation as well as normally.
    
    Don't forget about [Constants](src/main/java/frc/robot/util/Constants.java)!
