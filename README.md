# _**The Patribots (FRC 4738)**_
### Visit our website at [patribots.org](https://www.patribots.org)!

The Patribots are a school-based _FIRST&reg; Robotics Competition_ team from Patrick Henry High School, located in San Diego, California. 


This repository is entirely student-created and maintained.
Attached to this repository is a project called [Crescendo 2024](<https://github.com/orgs/Patribots4738/projects/3>) which we utilize as the Agile framework to organize our workflow. Using Agile, we map out the season by dividing it into nine week long sprints. As a team, we agree upon & decide what must be accomplished in each sprint. We declare each assignment by making issues and then implement it in an associated branch. An estimated priority & size are assigned to each issue/assignment which is then filtered into five categories:
  - **Backlog** -> Issues that have no status. Essentially a large to-do list.
  - **Ready** -> Issues that are assigned to a programmer & are ready to begin.
  - **In Progress** -> Issues that are currently being worked on by a programmer.
  - **In Review** -> Issues where the assigned programmer has requested revision by colleagues.
  - **Done** -> Resolved issues with corresponding branches which have merged into our master branch called [`main`](https://github.com/Patribots4738/Crescendo2024/tree/main/src/main).

We also love [drawing boards](<https://www.tldraw.com/r/EolJKYU3QEqxw71uyAqPS?viewport=5486,-1359,3403,1540&page=page:9NTiPVa29oqzjElya5D6n>)!
    
We are a team of students, for students, and we are proud to be a part of the _FIRST&reg;_ community.
Thanks for checking us out, & be sure to star this repository if you find anything helpful or interesting!

## Autonomous ü§ñ
  ### LED Position Indicator (LPI)
  We have a command called LPI that runs when the robot is turned on & disabled. This command was created to aid the technician in positioning the robot in the starting zone by displaying various LED patterns to convey the distance from the desired starting position & the percentage of error of the robot's rotation. This allows us to orient the robot with ease to eliminate the need to align to a field object such as the subwoofer, therefore giving us the liberty to start the game anywhere in the starting zone. Please view the section regarding major class functions below if you like to learn more. Also, check out the [LPI Concept Drawing Board](<https://www.tldraw.com/r/EolJKYU3QEqxw71uyAqPS?viewport=-3929,-1794,7449,3781&page=page:9NTiPVa29oqzjElya5D6n](https://www.tldraw.com/v/YKJloESPqAyu62wxqEQ8U?viewport=-3929,-1794,7449,3781&page=page:9NTiPVa29oqzjElya5D6n>)!
  
  ### Path Generation & Modular Autonomous Paths
  We use PathPlanner to construct a modular autonomous. In PathPlanner, we use waypoints, scheduled commands, & bezier curves to generate a singular auto path between a starting position, preferable shooting position, or note location. We then link multiple auto paths together to make one predetermined autonomous. Using note detection & logic, also allows us to make a modular autonomous path that can prevent us from going to a note position that has no note detected. This prevents the robot from visiting a location. Feel free to check out our [Modular Auto Drawing Board](<https://www.tldraw.com/v/mBaJ6QzdW6wNaRUvmB3DW?viewport=-121,-188,2715,1378&page=page:page>) :>

  ### Note Detection
  Using Limelight & machine learning, we can detect notes from 13 feet away. Note detection is incorporated in our modular autonomous logic, allowing us to skip over a note location if no note is detected. Those opposing robots are fast!

  ### Shooting While Driving
  Our robot is able to shoot notes into the speaker while moving sideways when relative to it. This feature grants us a shorter cycle time. If you are curious to learn more, check out the [Math](<https://www.tldraw.com/v/mBaJ6QzdW6wNaRUvmB3DW? viewport=-121,-188,2715,1378&page=page:page>) :D
  
  ### Field Centric Swerve Drive
  To make the robot more user-friendly for the driver, our swerve drive is field centric using our Pigeon 2.0 gyroscope to get our orientation on the field.
  
  ### Auto Alignment w/ April Tags
  Another feature for user-friendliness is our robot's ability to align to field objects such as the speaker, stage & amp. When aligned to the speaker, the driver can move the robot anywhere on the field whilst the shooter always faces the speaker. For the amp & stage, the robot becomes locked in a certain axis. This helps the driver with steering & alignment.

Our code is formatted in a <ins>command-based</ins> system on VS Code using <ins>Java<ins/>.
 
  - **Subsystems** [`robot/subsystems`](src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems) Folder containing class file for each subsystem on the robot.
    - **Intake** [`robot/subsystems/intake`](src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/intake) An under-the-bumper intake which is run by a Neo 550

    - **Indexer** [`robot/subsystems/indexer`](src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/indexer) The Indexer between intake & shooter which uses a Neo 550.
    - **Climb** [`robot/subsystems/climb`](src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/climb) Two independently driven climbs that conform to the curve of the unoccupied chain on stage to keep the robot level with the ground. Uses one Neo Vortex each.
    - **LEDS** [`robot/subsystems/limelight`](src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/leds) Our WS2812B LED strip.

The command cycles through the autonomous starting positions listed in [`robot/commands/autonomous/PathPlannerStorage`](src/main/java/frc/robot/commands/autonomous/PathPlannerStorage) & isolates the position closest to the robot's current position. It separates the surrounding area into defined zones & changes the LEDs to reflect the zone it is currently in. Once it is in the correct position, it displays a pattern to help the technician rotate the robot in the correct direction.

  - **Utilities** [`robot/util`](src/main/java/frc/robot/util)
    - **Constants** [`robot/util/constants`](src/main/java/frc/robot/util/constants) contains constants used throughout the robot code to prevent a mismatch in data & hardcoding values (Ex. PIDFF values & current limits).
    - **Calc** [`robot/util/calc`](src/main/java/frc/robot/util/calc) contains the calculations required for pivot alinment & shooter speeds when shooting while driving.
